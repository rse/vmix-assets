This UV map was generated by opening the
../vMix-VirtualSet-Flatten/uvmap-1080p.png in Photoshop, apply the
"Adaptive Wide Angle" filter, changing the filter "focal length" to
18,7, saving the result as a PSD file, opening the PSD file in GIMP and
exporting there as a PNG and during exporting selecting the pixel format
"16Bit RGBA" (as the result has to be 4x16=64bit PNG variant).
